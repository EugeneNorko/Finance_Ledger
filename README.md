Hi to all! My name is Eugene ðŸ‘‹ and this is my project <strong>Finance Ledger</strong>.

It was written using the HTML, SCSS, JS and some npm packages. The project contains one page, it is a landing.

You can see the project <a href="https://financeledgergoit.netlify.app/">HERE</a> ðŸ‘Œ

The landing contains:
<ul>
<li>Header with navigate</li>
<li>General Title</li>
<li>Five different section</li>
<li>One form</li>
<li>Footer</li>
</ul>

Some sections contain gallery and simple cards. You can interact with them! Just place your mouse under the block and see magic. Also website has dynamic navigation, so it is very convenient!

For develop I have used those technologies:
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>SCSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Parcel</li>
<li>Jquery</li>
<li>LightBox2</li>
<li>Modern normalize</li>
<li>posthtml-include</li>
</ul>

Also i have checked it on https://validator.w3.org/ and there are no errors!
